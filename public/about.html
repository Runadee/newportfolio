<p>Honestly , I did not find what is exactly for me in Softtware . Thats's why I am learning many languages and when I found my thing , I am planning to dive deeply on that field. I want to be a proffessional at one field. This a journey and I enjoy my journey as long as I keep going.</p>

<p>I am so curious person and like to learn new things and trying them. I have dreams and want to make all of them real. I am dancing, singing, painting , cooking and travelling . I appreciate to meet new people and explore new cultures . I am a lifelong learner and thats why I am thinking that I am superb suitable for this technologie field. I am so excited to take my first job and look forward to work with supportive teams.</p>
